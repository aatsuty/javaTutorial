
When using Drools, the business rules are defined in Drools Rule Language (DRL) files.

The default configuration of the Drools-based implementation defines an empty META-INF/kmodule.xml file
that will find and load all the DRL files in the classpath
(i.e.: this folder is tentative and actually not required).
